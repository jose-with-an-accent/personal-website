        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <p>A lot of work has been done for internships (which you can look at in my Resume), but here are a few things
            I've worked on:</p>
        <h4>drpÂ·rs</h4>
        <p>this is a Rust program that updates Discord Rich Presence information, so you can share music
            status or a watched movie with friends. it currently works with linux (and Plex/Tautulli on any platform), with
            Windows support planned soon.</p>
        <h5>Languages&Tools</h5>
        <p>Rust</p>
        <p>View on GitHub</p>
        <h4>College Explorer</h2>
        <p>Made for a competition, college-explorer was an app based on React.js and Firebase that allowed people to
        easily compare colleges and keep track of application status.</p>
    <h5>Languages&Tools</h5>
    <p>React.js, Firebase, Python (scripting)</p>
