# Personal Website

This repository contains information for a simple personal-website whose content is built from a YAML file. It's a simple site (as all things should be) and is edited with YAML. Usage of the Deno JavaScript runtime is required to build. Use `deno -A build.ts` to build it, or `deno -A build.ts -w` to watch the YAML and HTML files.

In the future, the script may generate a PDF of the Resume, however, I'm unsure of how well automatically-generated PDFs work with automated PDF readers that are used to hire.
