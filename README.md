# Personal Website

This repository contains information for a simple personal-website. It's a simple site (as all things should be) and is edited with YAML. Usage of the Deno JavaScript runtime is required to build. Use `deno -A build.ts` to build it, or `deno -A build_watch.ts` to watch the app.

Editing the YAML is the way to edit content.
